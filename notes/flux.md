###Flux Terminology 
- **Action**: generally a user event such as a form submission. Actions can also be created on the server.
- **Payload**: an object generated by the action. It includes the `type` of action and any associated `data`. The payload is sent to the dispatcher.  
- **Dispatcher**: a central hub of callback functions which directs action payloads to the correct store(s). It can also manage dependencies between stores, ensuring the application updates in a predictable way.  
- **Store**: manages an application's state, logic and data retrieval, and updates controller-views.
